TODO: weston_port: Improve mmap stuff (e.g. use MAP_TRYFIXED for enlargening
      a pool). On FreeBSD (MAP_FIXED | MAP_EXCL) seems to have the same effect.
TODO: utilize libdevattr in the drm-backend, instead of fixed device paths
      for the drm device [DONE]
      for sysmouse input [TODO]
TODO: For FreeBSD, probably need to use libdevq there.
TODO: send libxkbcommon fix to FreeBSD ports
TODO: talk to wayland upstream about wl_display_roundtrip flushing issue
